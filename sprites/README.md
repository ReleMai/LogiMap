## Sprite Guidelines

### Color Palette
- **Medieval/Fantasy Theme**
- Use muted, earthy tones
- Accent colors: Gold (#c4a574), Dark Brown (#1a1208)
- UI Background: Dark (#1a1a1a to #2a2a2a)
- Text: Light (#e0e0e0 to #e8e0d0)

### Scale
- Grid cell size: 32 pixels (base)
- Zoom range: 0.2x to 3.0x
- Sprites should look good at all zoom levels

### Style
- Pixel art with clean outlines
- Consistent lighting (top-left light source)
- Slight isometric feel for buildings
